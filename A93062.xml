         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THIS Book of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> is as it were the <hi>New Teſtaments</hi> book of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> containing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Records of the moſt remarkable Paſſages in thoſe Primitive, and pureſt times, and may deſervedly be ſtiled, <hi>The Acts and Monuments</hi> of the Apoſtles, and of the firſt Apoſtolicall Churches; Wherein we have ſummarily ſet down the manifold Pains, Travell, Succeſſe, or oppoſition which the Apoſtles met with in their propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Goſpell at firſt, and laying the happy foundation of Chriſtian Churches, amidſt a world of Infidells and Pagans.</p>
               <p>Yet among the Famous Acts of the Apoſtles, and memorialls of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Saints, you find inſerted, now and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170483:14"/> then, the foul, and infamous ſtoryes of ſome bloudy Perſecutor, or black <hi>hypocrite</hi> (a worſe ſhame, and greater Blot to the Chriſtian name and profeſſion) yea we have inſerted among the lives of Bleſſed Saints, <note place="margin">Act. 13. 8. <hi>and</hi> 16. 16.</note> the ſtory of ſeverall execrable <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> the worſt of men (as <hi>Elimas,</hi> and the <hi>Pytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſe,</hi> and this <hi>Simon)</hi> who made a ſtir in thoſe Early dayes, to the no ſmall trouble of the Church.</p>
               <p>But above all the reſt, there never was a worſe <hi>Fiſh</hi> caught by the net of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, then this <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who gives us the occaſion of this diſcourſe; The Vileſt <hi>Copronymus</hi> that ever received, and defiled holy Baptiſme: The fouleſt <hi>Ethiopian</hi> that ever holy water wet, and waſhed: whoſe <hi>Tripartite</hi> hiſtory is here briefly ſet down in this chapter, <hi>Naught</hi> in the whole, and each part worſe then other. His firſt part was in <hi>Sorcery,</hi> his ſecond in (ſhow, better, indeed much worſe) <hi>Hipocriſy;</hi> And his third worſt of all, <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and avowed <hi>Impiety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet is there a fourth part of his ſtory written by Eccleſiaſticall hyſtorians, his further progreſſe in all impiety, his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Goſpell, the hereſies which he Broached, The divine honors which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to, The ſtatues, and Images built to him, and to his ſtrumpet <hi>Helen</hi> (as unto a <note place="margin">Scortum ſuum Helenam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarem d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And we may ſafely ſay there is another <hi>Fift</hi> part (which though) not written, will be found and diſcovered in the laſt day ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. Theſe Sorcerers, Aſtrologers, cheators

               <p>5. Theſe Magicians are not ſo mad and vain, to brag, and boaſt, but a many more are as mad and vain to beleeve them, cry them up, and follow them: He ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 9. he was <hi>ſome great one.</hi> They overdo and <note place="margin">

               </p>

               <p>7. Where the true knowledge of God comes, the groſs impieties of theſe impoſtors are preſently ſmelt out, deteſted, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: But <hi>when thy believed Philip preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Here the unclean ſpirit goes out, but it is to fetch in ſeven worſe.</p>

But do you ever read that he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied a <hi>third time,</hi> or that he was ever the holier, or honeſter man for all this. Did he after all this propheſying ceaſe to perſecute <hi>David</hi> ever the more to his dying day? <hi>David</hi> is thought by ſome book learned men, to have a ſpirit of prophecy too, but he was ſilent here: But <hi>Saul</hi> and his bloudy followers, who ſought the life of <hi>David</hi> and

But <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, and <hi>Saul</hi> and his Meſſengers ſpirit were not alike. I reade indeed a third time of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying, mentioned 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 10. with his Javelin in his hand, but it was both a mad and counterfit propheſying; <hi>Junius</hi> renders it, <hi>prophetico more ſe componebat:</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> render it, <hi>Inſaniebat.</hi> He was mad.

But more horrid it is that the worſt monſter ſin, is bred of a leſſe egge, an evil thought. The evil thought is the Devils Dam, that the <hi>Succu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> the Devil the <hi>Incubus.</hi> It is the bed in which Satan lodgeth, in which his brats are conceived and born, The hot <hi>Sand</hi> in which this <hi>Oſtridge</hi> layes and leaves his eggs, which will hatch and bring forth of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed; then
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170483:24"/> when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when perfected, bringeth forth death, Jam.</hi> 1. 13. The evil thought is the <hi>Prima mater,</hi> or <hi>materia Prima,</hi> the firſt mother, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all ſin, capable of every form of evil. It is the little end of the wedge, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, makes way for the great to follow: The little <hi>Boy,</hi> which let in at the window, ſets the doores wide open, for all the greater Theeves to enter and carry all away.</p>
               <p>The Devil is more modeſt (or too much a ſerpent) to ſay at firſt, <hi>Curſe God and dy,</hi> Blaſpheme, caſt thy ſelfe down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, give me thy ſoule, commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and give thy ſelf over to all uncleanneſs with Greedineſſe, he hath learnt a better and ſurer way, he uſeth Art, method, Stratagems; And as <hi>Pompey</hi> when he had in vain aſſaulted a City, and could not take it by force, deviſed this Stratagem; In way of agreement, he told them he would leave the ſiege, and make peace with them; onely deſired he might leave a few weak and ſick ſouldiers among them to be cured; They let in, when the City was ſecure, let in <hi>Pompey's</hi> army: So Satan deſires but a look, or a wanton thought at firſt, he needes no more.

They ſay that witches have no power to hurt a man till they get or borrow ſomewhat of him, and if he give or lend them but the leaſt thing to the value of a halfpenny, they have enough now to do their will upon him.

               <p>Thoughts, ſome Divines rank into three ſorts: Though I ſhall reduce them to two, as to our purpoſe, and inſiſt mainly on one kind onely, even the worſt of the three. There are three kinds of thoughts, ſaith Learned and Acute Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> converſant about Evil.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt and moſt innocent whereof, is <note place="margin">

                     </gap>. 20.</note> about the ſimple and bare apprehenſion of Evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond, is not ſo good, when toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the apprehenſion of the mind, there is alſo ſome inclination in the Will to conſent.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:170483:33"/>3. The third and worſt, is when deliberated upon, it hath gained a full conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is without ſin, for it was found in Chriſt, when being tempted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. he fully and ſufficiently apprehended the Evil motion propounded, but deteſled and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred it. Hence it is a Maxime, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Caſe, <hi>Scire malum non eſt malum;</hi> barely to know evil is no evil. When <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> meditated and wrote of the wicked wiles of the ſubtile Harlot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 6, 7. When he gave himſelf to the Theory, to the ſtudying and inveſtigation of miſchief, and madneſſe, and folly. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 12. he was not thereby defiled, but inſtructed. The Phyſitian looking on the diſeaſe, is not thereby diſeaſed, nor the Miniſter when ſtudying or diſcourſing of the fouleſt nature of the fouleſt ſins, and Satans monſtrous methods, and ſtratagems, is nothing thereby defiled; yet had we need deal warily and conſiderately, as the Dogs at <hi>Nile,</hi> leaſt we ſhould be ſnapt; or as <hi>Ulyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Syrenes,</hi> ſtopt his ſervants ears, and bound himſelf to a Maſt, that he might not be inchanted by their Songs. So ſhould Miniſters and ſtudents, herein do as thoſe, who go by ſome ill and offenſive ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, they ſtop their noſes, or ſmell to ſome better ſent, to prevent the offenſiveneſſe.</p>
               <p>The other two kinds have both of them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170483:33"/> their part of ſin in them, and the later more. Holy <hi>Bernard</hi> makes alſo theſe three kinds, and reſembleth the firſt to <hi>Dirt,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>otteth the body, when daſht on it, but makes no bluneſſe, or skar; when it is waſhed, there is no ſign of it. The ſecond he reſembles to <hi>Blowes,</hi> which cauſe bruiſes, blackneſſe, wounds, thoſe make deformed and ſick and cauſe pain, but no death fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. But the third ſort of deliberate enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoughts, he compares to a mortall <hi>Stab,</hi> or deadly wound, which neglected brings certain death. So may a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be touched with the firſt, and troubled <note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let no man, ſaith he, be regardleſſe of the two former, for, <hi>etſi non ſint mortiferae ſunt certe periculoſae,</hi> although they be not deadly, yet are they dangerous.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall, as I ſaid, refer all ill Thoughts to two heads. There are ſome which are tranſient, unvoluntary, undeliberate, ſuch are as the motes in the cleareſt ſun-ſhine, and not as congregated clouds, cauſing any dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all, and are inſeparable from our cleareſt day and pureſt ſtate. <hi>Ex toto cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri non poſſunt quamdiu in hoc corpore mortis pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinamur a Domino.</hi> It is impoſſible to be wholly free from them, for any that yet carries about a body of death with him, ſaith the ſame <hi>Bernard.</hi> And hence it was that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170483:34"/> holy <hi>Auſtine</hi> was wont to pray, <hi>Educ me a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitatibus meis.</hi> Lord deliver me from my unavoidable ſins. My unavoidables are alſo inexcuſables. Theſe kind of thoughts, it is true, leſten not our Juſtification in the leaſt, which is perfect and compleat not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding them, no nor do they ſpoil ſanctification, though they grieve the Saint. Sanctification is nevertheleſſe true notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe, the leſſe perfect it is indeed, and perfection who looks for here? Theſe moates are as inſeparable from the mind, as the ſhadow from the body, and ſhew all is not yet ſo clear below; our ayre not ſo pure, and our earth, when thick fogs aſcend not, yet a duſt there is. Theſe are we to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <note place="margin">Daemonum est malas cogitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſuggerere, nostrum eſt cas illico expellere.

Theſe are like the Ship ſailing in the ſea, which cuts the waves, but leaves no impreſſion, like the Eagle in the air, or the Arrow ſhot out of the Bow, or like the Serpent on a Rock, which ſlides away and leaves no mention of their abiding.

There are ſix kinds of Atheiſts, and Atheiſme mentioned in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Negative</hi> Atheiſt, who <hi>hath not God in all his thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Profeſſed</hi> Atheiſt, who ſtudyeth to deſtroy the Deity and ſticketh not to affirm, <hi>there is no God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Practicall</hi> Atheiſt, who <hi>lives as if there were no God. Pſal.</hi> 36. 1. <hi>The wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the wicked ſaith within my heart, there is no fear of God before his eyes.</hi> It is all one not to acknowledge a God, and not to fear, ſerve and obey him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 4. and 53. 4. The Atheiſt is charged with, and convicted by this, <hi>That he calleth not on God.</hi> This proves him a <hi>Practicall,</hi> though he be not a <hi>Profeſſed</hi> Atheiſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is a <hi>Profeſsing</hi> (not profeſſed) Atheiſt, who <hi>Profeſſeth to know,</hi> love, and honour God, but <hi>by his workes denyeth him, being abominable diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith.

               </p>

So when we withdraw our dependance upon God and rely upon an arme of fleſh, or Satan, ſeeking to witches,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170483:39"/> and wizards: This is by conſequence or interpretation plain Atheiſme, for <hi>is there no God for thee in Iſrael to enquire of, that thou ſendeſt to Baalzebub the God of Ekron to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi>

The profeſſed Atheiſt would dipſute God out of Heaven, this <hi>Negative</hi> Atheiſt ſhuts him out of his own heart, and ſaith with the Legioniſt, <hi>What have I to do with thee.

Eſay.</hi> 30. 11. Yet doth he by his evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and uncogitancy depart from the living God. We commonly reckon ſins of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,</hi> ſins, as to ly, ſteal, or to think evil it may be; But of <hi>omiſsions,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>thoughts,</hi> who once taketh notice? whoſe heart ſmites him for this, I have no thoughts of my God. My heart is like <hi>Jericho</hi> ſhut <note place="margin">Joſh. 5. 1.</note> up, there is no ſuch thought comes in, there is no ſuch thought goes out, or peepes and breathes out. <hi>There is none ſaith where is God my maker, who giveth us ſongs in the night? Job</hi> 35. 10. whereas God made man purpoſely for himſelf, and gave man this <hi>Cogitative</hi> faculty, chiefly for this end, that he might in his mind and thoughts better meditate, conceive and comprehend
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170483:39"/> God, then in his words expreſſe him. It is a great and grievous offence, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of it in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, My people have forgotten me dayes without number.</hi> Out of ſight, out of mind. But <hi>can a Mayd</hi>

               <p>Holy <hi>Ignatius,</hi> could ſay, ſuch was his Love to Chriſt, and deſire after him, that if his heart were opened when he was dead, they ſhould find Jeſus Chriſt written there.

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Atheiſticall thoughts.</head>
               <p>HAving before ſpoke of ſeverall kindes of Atheiſts: I ſhall here ſpeak of the <hi>Atheiſticall thought;</hi> A thought ſo black, Irrationall, Bruitiſh and horrid as can be thought. A thought which may be darted and haply glance at a gracious heart, but can onely find footing and ſtick with a heart altogether graceleſſe. To ſhew the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and hatefullneſſe whereof, I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it cannot poſſibly be received but where the man hath firſt worne out his <hi>conſcience</hi> and all principles of religion. It doth <hi>ipſo facto, unſaint</hi> a <hi>Saint</hi> upon its firſt admiſſion. Some other Errors poſſibly may ſtand with grace, this entertained cannot.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor doth it ever ſtick, but where the man hath loſt his <hi>reaſon</hi> and his <hi>braines</hi> too,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170483:44"/> as well as his conſcience: It is not onely againſt the light of Scripture, but <hi>nature</hi> (even corrupted nature) and doth conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not onely <hi>un-ſaint</hi> the Chriſtian, but <hi>un-man</hi> the man. Some other Errors have ſome ſeeming reaſon on their ſide, This utterly none. It is the fool onely who ſaith (that is, imagineth) in his heart, <hi>There is no God.</hi> And have they no knowledge ſaith he afterwardes? No indeed, none <note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 1. and 4.</note> at all, either ſpirituall, or ſo much as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The whole Hoſt of heaven and earth, and all the creatures, animate, and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, combine together to bear witneſſe againſt this folly and impiety. They are all <hi>Gods witneſſes,</hi> and ſay to man if thou <hi>denyeſt</hi> a God, thou art a <hi>lyar,</hi> or if thou <hi>doubteſt</hi> thou art a fool, and we will prove it. For who could make theſe viſible heavens but the inviſible Deity? Who could make the eye but he who is all eye? and give the underſtanding, but he who is all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? Though many of the creatures are <hi>mute</hi> and cant ſpeak another word they all plainly pronounce this one word, <hi>A God, a God.</hi> This is the ſound of the harmony of the heavens, and the note of the whole univerſe, there is no ſpeech, nor language, where this voice is not heard. So much <hi>Divinity</hi> at leaſt is received for Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox among all Nations, eſtabliſhed not by particular, nationall, or general Counſells, convened (as ſome other points) but by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170483:44"/> the <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> counſell of mankind, (though never convened together) and ſubſcribed to <hi>man, by man,</hi> all the world over, and hath gained univerſall conſent in all ages, and places, as the firſt, if not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principle of naturall beliefe, and our <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natures</hi> Creed. Some Nations have one <hi>Creed,</hi> ſome another; ſome have altered their preſent <hi>Creeds,</hi> this was never altered, but received by all without diſpute, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. There be ſome people that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſome books of holy Scripture onely, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> of old, and the Turk at this day, of the five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Some receive the Old Teſtament entirely, as the Jowes; Some receive the old and New Teſtament both, as the ſound Chriſtian Churches; Some admit the Apocrypha and unwritten Traditions too, as the Papiſts; Some reject all the whole Bible, and have no written Scripture. But all have this Scripture written in their hearts, the moſt ancient Scripture in the world, before there were any penman of holy <hi>Writ.</hi> And this is univerſally received, and read in all nations in their mother Tongue, and expounded in their ſeveral, and different (the moſt corrupt) exerciſes of religion and worſhip. There have been ſeveral <hi>Sorts of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> in the world, one oppoſing and thwarting anothers Axiomes; there have been ſeveral ſects of <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the Church, all oppoſing other truthes, and rejecting
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170483:45"/> the ſoundeſt Creeds. There have been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in all <hi>ſciences,</hi> diſputes againſt every thing ſaid or practiſed in all arts, trades, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. But all ſorts of Philoſophers, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, of all arts, trades, profeſſions and ſciences have unanimouſly concurred in this, when nothing elſe, <hi>There is a God.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever People are divided by Lands and Seas, diſſonant in their Language, and complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more different in their lawes, cuſtomes, manners, apparell, yet in this, all Nations by a divine inſtinct harmoniouſly agree, there is, and of force muſt be acknowledged, <hi>There is a God.</hi> And a little reaſon will ſerve to prove it, for, as when I ſee a ſon, I muſt needs yeeld this child had a Father, ſo when I ſee the creatures I muſt needs grant a Creator, who is the Lord. Therefore hold this faſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is the moſt <hi>Deſtructive</hi> thought and error in the world. Some errors are about the <hi>Superſtructure,</hi> this a fundamentall error; ſome fundamentall errors impugne ſome one article of faith, or principall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; This is deſtructive of all Religion; deſtroyes all divinity and humanity too, it leaves us never an article of faith, never a command in the Decalogue, and never a point of doctrine. It leaves not <hi>a ſtone upon a ſtone,</hi> but pulls down all. This ſmites the glorious Statute of Body of Religion upon his feet, and breaks all to pieces, and brings it down to the ground, deſtroying piety,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170483:45"/> civility, humanity, curteſy, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of common reaſon, as that ſtone which ſmote that Image in <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſo that Gold, <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 24.</note> ſilver, braſſe, iron, and clay, all crumbled in pieces, and became like the chaffe in the ſummer threſhing-flore.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Atheiſm in the thought, is a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin,</hi> a big-bellied monſtrous ſin, having in its womb all manner of impiety, and like <hi>Babylons</hi> Cup, is full of all manner of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Atheiſm never goes alone; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is added, <hi>Pſal. 14. 1, 2. The fool ſaid there was no God: Corrupt are they, and have done abominable works,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt thing I ſhall obſerve is, that there is ſo much <hi>Irrationallity</hi> in this thought, that it is baniſhed the world and excluded the ſociety of man; and ſo much of <hi>Impiety</hi> in it, that it is not onely excluded heaven, but this of all other ſins is excluded out of hell too. There is no Atheiſm to be found in hell, there is blaſphemy, malice, envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Atheiſme. The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> goes to hell, <hi>Atheiſme</hi> doth not,</p>
               <q>Nullus in Inferno eſt Atheos, ante fuit.</q>
               <p>And is not this a mad and monſtrous impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which can be harboured in the heart, when neither heaven, earth, or hell it ſelf, will own it? The devils and damned are herein ſounder then thou art, they believe and tremble. And the Atheiſt herein is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170483:46"/> the devils Proſylite, two fold more a child of hell then his maſter.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this, haply, if we be not more aware, we may find this <hi>fools Bolt</hi> ſhot into our hearts, and theſe <hi>fiery darts</hi> injected by the Prince of darkneſſe, who as he deceived our firſt Parents with this cheat, would put the ſame upon us; <hi>You ſhall be as Gods.</hi> A god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoul may ſometime be dog'd and hanted with ſuch tentations, but take heed of parly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, or pauſing on them. Reſiſt this devil and he will fly from you. This <hi>Cerberus</hi> cannot chuſe but affright and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, when he barks in thy ears, Believe no God, worſhip no God, renounce God, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure Religion, <hi>Curſe God and dye, or eat and live.</hi> fall down and worſhip, and thou ſhalt riſe and be worſhipped. But take heed of giving the leaſt entertainment to ſuch a thought, or ſo much as to debate them, but break off abruptly with <hi>Michaels</hi> farewell; <hi>The Lord rebuke thee Satan.</hi>

Above all, to make God ſuch a one as hath pleaſure in wickedneſſe, not to reprove and puniſh it, or to have no ſuch pleaſure in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe as to approve and reward it, is the higheſt, and moſt daring impiety that can be.

               <p>BUT of the thoughts of <hi>preſumption</hi> the world is more full.

               <p>1. <hi>Carnall</hi> all are ſubject unto, hence if we have an <hi>arm of fleſh</hi> to truſt in, how apt <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 5.</note> are we to ſwell and to depart from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, And if we find our <hi>mountain to ſtand ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>lower ſprings</hi> of creature ſupplies to run freſh, a <hi>David</hi> is too apt to ſay, <hi>I ſhall never be moved,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 6.</note> which cauſeth God to hide his face, and turn our ſprings into bloud, that we may learne to know on what ground we ſtand; And ordinarily the men of the world, if

               </p>
               <p>So if any thing <hi>have been undertaken</hi> and ſucceeded, how apt are we to attribute all to our ſelves? and to <hi>ſacrifice to our own net,</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

You will not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus, God hath decreed there ſhall be Seed-time and Harveſt while the world ſtandeth, therefore we need not plow or ſow; or if thy houſe were on fire, and thou in thy bed, thou wouldeſt not ſay, if God have a purpoſe to ſtay the fire, I need not cry out, or ſtir out of my bed, but thou wilt find a tongue to call, hands and feet to ſtirre, and haſt thou no hands, nor feet, nor cries, nor prayers, nor teares to eſcape Hell. Faith ſees a ſweet conſonancy between decrees and promiſes, precepts, threats and means; Preſumption is not content to oppoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf, but would ſet all Heaven in a flame, making variance between <hi>decree and decree,</hi> (as of <hi>ſalvation and ſanctification,</hi> both decreed ſimultaneouſly and at once, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13.) between <hi>decrees</hi> and <hi>promiſes, decrees</hi> and <hi>precepts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many are apt to preſume on ſalvation, relying <hi>totally and ſolely</hi> on Gods mercy, as they think, (which is indeed the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of Saints) but not in way of duty and holy fear, departing from ſin, and they think they give much glory to God by relying on his mercy ſo much as they do; but the Lord abhors this preſumption. When wicked men ſay, I ſhall have peace, though I walk after the Imagination of my heart, adding drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thirſt, <hi>The Lord ſaith, he will not ſpare ſuch, but his anger and jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 29. 19, 20. So

Therefore ſhall Zion for their ſake be plowed like a field, and Jeruſalem become heaps, and the mountain of the houſe as the high places of the forreſt.</hi> Is there no way to exalt Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> but by deſtroying his <hi>juſtice,</hi> purity, truth and holineſſe?

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Many have preſumed themſelves into Hell by a vain dream of <hi>long life,</hi> and a fond preſumption of <hi>late repentance,</hi> when we can neither <hi>boaſt of to morrow,</hi> or were we aſſured of longer life, have we any promiſe of late repentance: <hi>Qui promittit penitenti veniam, non promittit peccanti penitentiam;</hi> God hath made a promiſe of pardon to the penitent, but none of repentance to the preſumptuous

                  <hi>that have been accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Is it a likely matter thou ſhouldeſt pull up <hi>an Oake</hi> of <hi>twenty years</hi> growth and deep rooted in the earth, which thou canſt not pull up after it hath ſtood but <hi>one year,</hi> but mighteſt eaſily the ſame day it was ſet: Is repentance like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be any thing eaſier to a dying man when all his ſins come flocking in together, when paines torment, when ſtrength and underſtanding faile, when friends diſtract, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Is it likely a dying man ſhould be able to do more, and bear a heavier burden then a man in his ſtrength? Is it likely a man ſhould find that in the dark and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon it, which they could never find in the light? How irrationall are thoughts of late repentance! But that many are willing to deceive themſelves, and preſume to find a ſhort and eaſie way to life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If thou ſhouldeſt then repent, it is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170483:66"/> a great queſtion whether ſuch repentance would be accepted, for though <hi>true</hi> repentance is never <hi>too late,</hi> yet this <hi>late</hi> repentance is ſeldome <hi>true.</hi> God may juſtly ſhut the door upon thee, and ſay, I know thee not, Depart thou rejecter of my grace, thou worker of iniquity; <hi>Go to the Gods that you have choſen, Jud.</hi> 10. 14. or as in <hi>Deut. 32. 37, 38. Where are the Gods, and the rock in whom they truſted? Which did eat the fat of their ſacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings, let them ariſe, and ſave thee in the time of thy trouble,</hi> or let them that have had the <hi>beſt,</hi> take all the <hi>reſt</hi> too. I am not willing to judge any mans eſtate that is gone before, with his late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: But I remember what once <hi>Saint Auſtin,</hi> Excellently ſaid on ſuch an occaſion, he was asked what <hi>he would ſay of a man that lived wickedly, and died peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, and had confeſſed his ſins, and was abſolved, why ſaith he, what ſhall I ſay? ſhall I ſay he is damned? No I will not, for I may not judge him; What then ſhall I ſay, he is ſaved? no I will not, for I may not deceive thee; but ſhall I ſay nothing? Yes ſaith he, this is all I ſay to thee, repent thou truly, and timely, and thou art ſafe. And if thou wilt repent when thou canſt not ſin, thy ſins have left thee, and not thou thy ſins.</hi> Laſtly I would reaſon with thoſe that intend a late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and aske them what they think of repentance; <hi>Is it good, or is it evil?</hi> If it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170483:66"/> be <hi>good,</hi> why do they not <hi>get</hi> it now? If <hi>evil,</hi> why will they ſeek it at <hi>any time?</hi> But if thou thin eſt it good, and yet defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the practiſe of it, ſo oft as thou thinkeſt it good, thou <hi>condemneſt thy ſelf,</hi> and ſo oft as thou thinkeſt it evil, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt to practiſe it at laſt, ſo oft thou <hi>condemneſt repentance,</hi> and the grace of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And there is another preſumptuous thought, and as deſtructive as any the former, which is of ſuch who think to fly to the <hi>death of Chriſt, and the grace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> yet ſtill live in their ſins. They ſay we cannot <hi>outſin</hi> the death of Chriſt, nor can our ſins come up to the meaſure of the grace of God, but if ſin abound never ſo much, grace will yet more abound. But do you thus requite the Lord, ye fooliſh people and unwiſe? Shall we ſay, <hi>Let us continue in ſin that grace may abound?</hi>

               <p n="5">5. I ſhall mention but one more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous thought, which is the preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon our own ſtrength of grace, and many have been overthrown by this. <hi>In te ſtas, &amp; non ſtas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin,</hi> thou wouldeſt ſtand of thy ſelf, and therefore canſt not ſtand, <hi>In me ſtas, qui nonſtas,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; In me thou ſhalt be ſure to ſtand who canſt not ſtand; <hi>Peter</hi> is a ſad warning to us, who <hi>over-confident</hi> of his own ſtrength, was ſoon frighted into a baſe ly, and curſed oath and execration, at the firſt look and word of a confident girle.

The Scripture brands all the wiſe men of the world for a pack of fooles, and ſcores up their wiſdome for ſtark fooliſhneſſe, as I ſaid before, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 19. and if the wiſdome of the wiſe be folly, what is the fooliſhneſſe of the fooles but folly in graine.

               <head>CHAP. XXI. The hypocriticall thought.</head>
               <p>LAſtly, we may not forget the <hi>hypocriticall</hi> thought, which makes the heart as bad as any other. What are we better if we have not <hi>Atheiſticall, Blaſphemous,</hi> or <hi>hard</hi> thoughts of God, if we have <hi>low, baſe and diſhonorable</hi> thoughts, not glorifying him as God, an <hi>heart ſearching</hi> omniſcient God. There is no greater abomination in the eyes of God, no greater reproach to the Church, and no ſtranger monſter in the world then the hypocrite is. In face and ſpeech he is an Angel, in heart and life a devill, hath a <hi>head</hi> of Gold, <hi>feet</hi> of clay, and heart of dirt. He is a black feind in a <hi>Prophets</hi> mantle, an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> with a Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh Garment and wedge of Gold in his tent, <hi>a Syrian</hi> outwardly cleanſed, in heart a <hi>Rimmonite;</hi> a diſciple with a <hi>Bagge,</hi> and a devill with an holy <hi>Soppe;</hi> a <hi>Pſudo-nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi> by day with Chriſt, by night with the High Prieſts in their Conclave; a baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard <hi>Moſes,</hi> who puts on a vaile when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares before God, or before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> puts it off when he comes into his cloſet, or among his companions. He hath ever a cloven foot, a cloven heart and cloven tongue, that you may know whoſe child he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170483:83"/> is: He haltes between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> God and <hi>Rimmon,</hi> God and <hi>Mammon,</hi> God and <hi>Molech.</hi> He hath a cloven foot, with one knee bowing to God, with the other to <hi>Rimmon;</hi> he hath a cloven, or double heart, with one heart embracing God, with the other <hi>Mammon;</hi> a cloven tongue too, <hi>he can ſwear by God, and ſweare by Malcham</hi> too. He can pronounce <note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Shibboleth</hi> and <hi>Sibboleth</hi> too, and can ſpeak the language of <hi>Canaan</hi> and the language of <hi>Aſhdod</hi> both. Theſe will needs purſue Chriſt and profeſſion, as <hi>Aſahell</hi> dogged <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> whom he would have been ſhut off, that he might not have deſtroyed him. <hi>Turn thee</hi>

He will at length give them their deaths wound: All their ſacrifices are abomination, as being offered with <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and wanting the <hi>Salt</hi> of ſincerity. What an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and <hi>ſteale</hi> and <hi>diſſemble</hi>

Ah Sirs, God will
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170483:83"/> not be mocked, God will not be enquired of by ſuch! God will anſwer them by himſelf. All Idols are abomination, but the Idol in the heart, is the greateſt: All <hi>falſhood</hi> is abomination to the Lord, falſity in a <hi>ballance,</hi> falſity in the <hi>ſpeech,</hi> but moſt of all in the <hi>heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>truth</hi> commends every thing that <hi>good</hi> is, and makes it much <hi>better,</hi> ſo <hi>falſity</hi> debaſeth every thing that <hi>ſeemes</hi> never ſo good, and makes it ſtark naught, what more delightfull to heare then good news? It is <hi>good</hi> if <hi>true</hi> we ſay. So are gold, Jewels, Pearls highly valued if <hi>true,</hi> not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</p>
               <p>A <hi>true</hi> profeſſor, and a <hi>true Iſraelite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> who knows his worth how highly doth <note place="margin">Jo. 1. 47.</note> God eſteem him? a <hi>Prophet,</hi> how highly is he honoured in the Church, above another profeſſor? but he muſt be a <hi>true</hi> Prophet; an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> above a Prophet, if a <hi>true</hi> Apoſtle; The <hi>Meſſias</hi> above them all, but it muſt be the <hi>true Meſſias</hi> then; And <hi>God</hi> above him too, but it muſt be the <hi>true</hi> God. On the other ſide, how doth falſity debaſe every thing: A falſe <hi>ballance</hi> bad, a falſe <hi>tongue</hi> worſe, a falſe <hi>heart</hi> worſe ſtill, a falſe <hi>Profeſſor</hi> worſe yet, a counterfeit Apoſtle, or falſe <hi>Prophet</hi> worſe yet, A falſe <hi>Religion,</hi> or fained <hi>Goſpel</hi> worſe ſtill, But a falſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a falſe <hi>God</hi> worſt of all.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>adulterate</hi> their Coyn, and ſtamp their Image on baſe mettall; what will be done to them, can we imagine, that ſhall be found guilty of adulterating Gods Coyne, and ſtamping the Image and ſuperſcription of God, and the Effigies of holy profeſſion, upon a baſe droſſy heart, and ſpotted life?</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Of Evil Thoughts towards our Neighbour.</head>
               <p>VVEE are now come into another field of <hi>Tares</hi> (without <hi>Wheat)</hi> or into another <hi>Room</hi> of the <hi>Chambers of Imagery,</hi> where is a new diſcovery of more <hi>Abominations</hi> yet; Or among another army of enemies, againſt whom we muſt oppoſe our ſelves, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> when come over <hi>Jordan,</hi> were to encounter with the <hi>Canaanites, nearer home.</hi> We are to ſpeak of a <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of ill thoughts, which concern our <hi>Neighbour;</hi> and of theſe are very many kindes; we ſhall point at ſome of the chief of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is, <hi>The evil eye, Mar.</hi> 7. 22. mentioned in the Inventory of the evil heart. <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>an evil eye.</hi> There be many <hi>evil eyes</hi> in the world; And theſe are as clear indications of the mind in many caſes, as the <hi>tongue</hi> or <hi>hands. Solomon</hi> ſaith, the wicked winketh with the <hi>eye,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:170483:84"/> 
                  <hi>and ſpeaketh with his feet.</hi> The <hi>eye</hi> is the <hi>tongue</hi> of the ſoul more then the <hi>feet;</hi> and <note place="margin">Ubi amor ibi oculus. <hi>So,</hi> Ubi odium, ira, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ibi oculus.</note> many ſins, as adultery, luſt, pride, envy, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, revenge, murther, are as legible in the eye, as in the act; Some of which onely hurt the perſon himſelf; as adultery in the eye defiles the beholder, the other not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all defiled; murder in the eye kills the beholder, the other not being touched; ſo pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet alwaies it intends the evil of his neighbour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>envy,</hi> is a very bad and ſore Eye; the diſeaſe of hell, the firſt ſin of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, (ſay ſome Divines) which threw him out of heaven, becauſe envying that man an inferiour creature, ſhould be dignified above his angelical nature in the intended aſſuming of our humane nature, by the Son of God; but certain it was, his firſt ſin after his fall, when he came down full of rage againſt God, and envy at man ſtanding, whom he now wiſhed to be almoſt, and altogether ſuch as himſelf, in his bonds of ſin and miſery. It is a fly alwaies bred in dung, a vice onely found in a baſe, low and malignant ſpirit, which joyes in, and ſeeks the hurt and downfal of others, and grieves at, and hinders the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thus was <hi>Saul</hi> Eye-ſick, when he ſaw <hi>David</hi> honoured by the people in their ſongs and dances. <hi>Saul was very wroth and ſaid, they have aſcribed to David ten thouſands, to me but thouſands, what can he have more but the Kingdome?</hi> And <hi>Saul eyed David</hi> (with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170483:85"/> an obſerving, miſchievous, and envious eye) <hi>from that day and forward. Saul</hi> was well <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 8, 9.</note> content that <hi>David</hi> ſhould adventure his perſon, when he ſate ſtill, but could not brook it, that he ſhould have any ſhare in the peoples affections, and acclamations; but he thinks his own honour eclipſed. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> he eyed <hi>David</hi> too, but that was with an <hi>Eye of reſpect,</hi> his heart <hi>was knit to him, he loved him as his own ſoul;</hi> as we ſay, he could <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 1.</note> not tell whether he might <hi>hear him or ſee him,</hi> he could never look enough on him; But <hi>Saul</hi> eyed him, as if he would have run him through with his <hi>Eyes,</hi> as well as with his <hi>Javelins.</hi> He looked at him (I will not ſay, as in our Proverb, the devil looked over <hi>Lincolne,</hi> but) as the devil looked over <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe,</hi> while man remained innocent, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ruine. Take heed of this foul ſin, <hi>Charity envieth not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; But <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> the corrupt ſpirit, that is in all the ſons of men, doth naturally luſt unto this ſin of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</p>
               <p>And yet is there a worſe <hi>Eye of envy</hi> than this, which lookes a ſquint, not onely where men beſtow their favours unequally, (as they think) but when God ſhall beſtow his unequally, as they ſuppoſe, on thoſe who have not deſerved ſo well, done or ſuffered ſo much as themſelves. There were that murmured againſt the good man of the houſe at his diſtributions, to whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>May I not do what I will with mine own, Is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 15.</note>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:170483:85"/> 
                  <hi>thine eye evill becauſe I am good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet a <hi>worſe,</hi> (whereof a ſpice ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in <hi>Joſuah)</hi> when we emulate the gifts and graces of God beſtowed on others, as if our ſelves were eclipſed by their luſter. To whom a <hi>Moſes</hi> would ſay, Let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, let me decreaſe; <hi>Oh that all the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Num. 11. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Lords people did propheſie, and that the Lord would pour out of his ſpirit upon all. Moſes</hi> had a ſelf-denying heart, and a bountifull eye; <hi>Whatſoever</hi> was good in Gods eye, was good in his too.</p>
               <p>2. There is an evil <hi>Eye of diſdain. There is a generation</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>Oh how lofty are their eyes! and their eye-lids are lifted up. Prov.</hi> 30. 13. Thus <hi>Haman</hi> looked <note place="margin">Eſt. 3. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Superciliouſly</hi> on <hi>Mordecai,</hi> as if he could have eaten him, when he thought ſcorn to foul his hands with him. Thus ſcornfull <hi>Michal,</hi> in her heart, diſdained her husband, <note place="margin">1 Chro. 15. 19.</note> when he danced before the Arke, as if ſhe a Kings daughter, had been diſparaged by her husbands ardent zeal and piety. A baſe and wicked diſpoſition this is, and God ever owes ſuch a ſhame. He reſiſteth the proud, and will <hi>bring down the proud looks,</hi> as well as the proud hearts. Thus the Scripture often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 27.</note> the wicked by their geſtures; <hi>Wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the eye,</hi> Prov. 10. 10. Pſal. 35. 19. <hi>Putting out the fingers,</hi> Eſay 58. 9. as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſdainfull ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Yet is there alſo a good Eye of holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and contempt in Godly men, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:170483:86"/> 15. 4. <hi>In whoſe eyes,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>a vile and wicked perſon is contemned:</hi> Noble <hi>Mordecai</hi> looked upon <hi>Haman</hi> as vile and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in midſt of all his high Titles and great offices of advancement. And holy <hi>Eliſha</hi> looked upon a wicked <hi>King,</hi> as ſo worthleſſe a perſon, that in his holy contempt, he ſaid, he would not have vouchſafed to make him an anſwer, <hi>or lend him a look, were it not for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 King 3. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the preſence of Jehoſhaphat, whom he</hi> more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for his Grace, than for his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</p>
               <p>3. The evil Eye of <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> whereas Charity thinketh no evil, but interprets all in the beſt ſenſe, and will rather chuſe to make the beſt of evil, than the worſt of bad, or bad of good. <hi>Deviſe not evil againſt thy neighbour,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>when he dwells ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>by thee,</hi> and intends thee no harm. But ſuſpicion and jealouſie looks upon every good act and office done with an evil eye. <hi>David</hi> ſends to <hi>Hanun</hi> to condole the death of his Father, and to congratulate his peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 3.</note> ſucceſſion in the Throne. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to be a perfidious act, to fore-run an invaſion by ſending his meſſengers as ſpies, to obſerve the nature, manners, and preparations of his Countrey. This ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a botch breaking out in a baſe and foul heart, infected with fraud, falſhood, or other filthy guilt, and is the bane of ſecure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and is to be baniſhed out of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an breaſts, as the great enemy to humane
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170483:86"/> ſociety, and true friendſhip.</p>
               <p>4. The Cenſorious Eye, is another evil eye. It is <hi>Totus oculus ad extra, totus tenebrae ad intra,</hi> all eye without, all darkneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. He hath a <hi>Beam</hi> in his own eye, yet ſeeth never the worſe, but the better to eſpy the leaſt mote in his brothers eye: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſincere perſon, is <hi>totus oculus ad intra,</hi> The leaſt mote troubles him makes him weep, wipe, waſh; But his neighbours mote or beam troubles him not.</p>
               <p>5. The <hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>Greedy Eye,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil Eye. As there is a <hi>Bountifull Eye</hi> that ſhall be bleſſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 9. He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his bread to the poor, when he ſees their want, his eye pitties them. So <hi>he that haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be rich,</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Solomon, hath an</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>evil eye,</hi> a covetous and cruel eye, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth not that poverty ſhall come on him.</hi> His eye is never ſatisfied with ſeeing his own wealth, and anothers woe; he thinks much to ſee another live by him, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard already in his eye, <note place="margin">Deut. 15. 9.</note> and is ſick with diſcontent, if he cant get him part with it. Their deſires are <hi>enlarged as hell,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, and they ſeek to add <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 15.</note> houſe to houſe, and field to field, till there be no more place, that they may be placed <note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 8.</note> alone in the midſt of the earth.</p>
               <p>6 The <hi>Eye of adultery</hi> is another evil eye, wherewith ever the beholders heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and often the chaſtity of another is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered. The harlots <hi>eye-lids</hi> are very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170483:87"/> 
                  <hi>Proverbs</hi> 6. 25.</p>
               <p>7. The <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>revengefull Eye</hi> is a deviliſh evil Eye, ſuch was <hi>Cains,</hi> who caſt many a ſower and menacing look at his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> when he gave him never a word. Which malice and miſchief in his thoughts and looks the Lord reproved, when <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> he ſaid, <hi>Cain why art thou wroth with thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and why is thy countenance caſt down?</hi> This is Eye-murder, or <hi>heart-murder;</hi> as the former Unchaſt Eye is called <hi>heart-adultery,</hi> or <hi>Eyes full of adultery,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>8. The <hi>Unnaturall</hi> and <hi>Ungracious</hi> Eye of children to their parents, or thoſe in neareſt relations is worſt of all, ſometimes the eye of the <hi>Husband</hi> is evil to the <hi>Wife,</hi> and the <hi>Wife</hi> to her <hi>Husband,</hi> yea the tender mother to her tender babe, but that is not ordinary; but in time of extreameſt famine, and <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 54, 55, 56, 57.</note> calamity, and is then the ſoreſt judgement and the height of all miſery. But it is <hi>too ordinary</hi> to ſee the child look with an evil eye upon his aged and indigent parents, and this is the height of impiety, and the moſt prodigious of ſins and inhumanity. <hi>The eye that mocketh his father and deſpiſeth to obey his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>mother, the ravens of the valley ſhall pick it out, and the young eagels ſhall eat it.</hi> He ordinarily dies a ſhamefull death, and lies unburied, then do the Crowes and Eagles prey upon his carcaſſe as carrion, and begin with the eyes as they uſually do. <hi>He that curſeth his father or mother,</hi> he ſaith againe in another
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170483:87"/> place, <hi>his lamp ſhall be put out in obſcure dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 20. 20.</note> Many ſuch ſad examples we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in all ages, of theſe ſons of <hi>Cham,</hi> and brothers of <hi>Abſalom;</hi> whereof the one in mirth and ſport beheld his Fathers naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and prophanely inſulted over his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, him the Father laid his curſe upon by <hi>imprecation,</hi> and God upon his poſterity <hi>by execution.</hi> The other ungraciouſly beheld his Fathers honour, and long life, <hi>with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,</hi> he thought the old man would never die, he ſeeks to aſperſe his Government, and make him uncapable of the Crown, that himſelf being the eldeſt Son, might have the Crown before his Fathers death. Him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Father pittied, and deſired he might be ſpared, but vengeance ſuffered him not to eſcape. The Crowes were near pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his eyes, when he was by divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance hanged between heaven and earth, unworthy to go to the one, or to tread upon the other. Think of this you undutifull and ungracious Children; if to honour Parents be the firſt command, then to diſhonour and diſobey them is the firſt of ſins. If to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naturall affection, be ſuch a heatheniſh ſin, what is it to have naturall affection <note place="margin">Rom. 131.</note> turned into unnaturall diſaffection and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; To be thornes in the ſides, and pricks in the eyes of their deareſt Parents, and to prove ſuch a curſe, as <hi>Elies</hi> ſons, thoſe who died, were a great grief dying in their ſins, and cut off by divine Vengeance, but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170483:88"/> thoſe who lived were a greater eye-ſore, and heart-break. <hi>That man of thine, whom I ſhall not cut off,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall be to conſume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart.</hi> Which <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 33.</note> hath made unhappy Parents cry out, <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up Children, and they have proved Vipers,</hi> riſing up againſt me. How happy the womb that never bare, and the paps which never gave ſuck, and to wiſh with <hi>Auguſtus</hi> becauſe of the lewdneſſe of his Daughters, would God I had either lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, or died without Children.</p>
               <p>There be many other kinds of evil Thoughts againſt our Brother, whereof we ſhall inſtance in ſome, not ſpeaking much to them, but pointing briefly at them. Only we ſhall lay down this Rule, that <hi>he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to love God, commandeth us to love</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 John. 4. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>our brother alſo;</hi> And he who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that we ſhould have none but high, holy, honourable, and reverend thoughts of him, and that we ſhould think ſoberly concerning our ſelves, commandeth that we ſhould have none but fair, juſt, favourable, and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of our Neighbour, <hi>Zach. 7. 9, 10. Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of hoſts, Execute true judgement, and ſhew mercy and compaſſion every man to his brother, and oppreſſe not the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, the fatherleſſe, the ſtranger, nor the poor, and let none of you imagine evil againſt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your heart.</hi>

               <p>1. <hi>CEnſorious Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>raſh judging</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cenſorious Thoughts.</note> of our Brother, of his heart and ſtate, ſeverely forbidden and threatned in the Scriptures, as a ſacrilegious inthroning our ſelves in Gods Tribunall, a ſin never ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as now: This Miniſter is <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that is a <hi>Time-ſerver,</hi> this man a <hi>hypocrite,</hi> that man a <hi>formaliſt,</hi> but all are judges, and all are judged, and all are condemned.

                  <hi>ye judge ye ſhall be judged,</hi> condemne and be condemned? <hi>Why doſt thou judge thy brother?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and why ſet at naught thy Brother? What haſt thou to do to judge another mans ſervant? To</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>his own Maſter he muſt ſtand or fall,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. If our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Man, who made</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>me a judge?</hi> do not thou make thy ſelf a judge, unleſſe, <hi>of thy ſelf;</hi> here thou haſt a <note place="margin">1 Co. 11. 31.</note> Patent, there none. <hi>Grudge not one againſt another,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>James, leſt you be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>behold the judge ſtandeth before the door;</hi> and wilt thou keep him out, and prevent him from doing his own work?</p>
               <p>But we are not to wonder (as one ſaith) if the world be full of <hi>unjuſt judgements,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:170483:89"/> when there are <hi>ſeven</hi> dangerous <hi>Judges</hi> alwais abroad in their <hi>Circuit,</hi> who have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Commiſſions, and will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to lay them down.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Judge Weak,</hi> an unfit perſon to make a Judge, yet is he the beſt of the ſeven, for he hath no ill meaning. He that yet knowes not the latitude of Goſpel-Liberty, if he ſee another do but what he lawfully may, he cries out of licenciouſneſſe. The <hi>weak</hi> is apt to <hi>Judge,</hi> as the <hi>ſtrong</hi> to <hi>deſpiſe, Rom.</hi> 14. 3. Thus <hi>Simon</hi> when he ſaw ſo wicked a woman come ſo near to Chriſt, and he permit it, began to change his former good opinion he had of Chriſt, that if he were ſo good a man <note place="margin">Luke 7. 39.</note> and ſo great a Prophet as the world took him for, he would not ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er ſuch a woman to touch him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Judge Haſtings,</hi> or Inconſiderateneſſe, is a raſh Judge. This made <hi>Eli</hi> ſo raſhly cenſure mourning <hi>Hannah</hi> for a drunken goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſip, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 14.</note> when (bleſſed Saint) ſhe ſhe more teares then ſhe had drunk wine. And what were they who ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> without all doubt, this man is a murderer? <hi>Acts</hi> 28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Judge Hearſay,</hi> is another Incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge; He takes things upon report, never weighing circumſtances, conſidering the quality of the Informers, or once giving them their oath. Jeſus Chriſt though he was the fitteſt perſon to judge, <hi>did not judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hearing of the ear,</hi> Eſa. 11. 3. The Lord himſelf came down into <hi>Sodom</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:170483:89"/> to make a more full diſcovery of the truth of that report which was carried up to heaven. <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 21.</note> But now a daies a baſe report againſt the beſt man, from the worſt hands, is evidence enough to proceed to condemnation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Judge Prejudice,</hi> or <hi>Erroneouſneſſe,</hi> (I cannot call him <hi>Juſtice)</hi> is a fierce and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Judge ready to condemn thoſe of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mindes, be they never ſo pious and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſuch a one was <hi>Paul</hi> once towards the Apoſtles and other Saints, and ſuch he met with afterwards. He had Judged them, and now they Judged him the great diſturber of the Churches peace, and corrupter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> is another mercileſſe Judge, he with his Beam in his own Eye condemns his brothers Mote. <hi>Clodius occuſat Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Prophaneſſe</hi> is a <hi>furious Judge,</hi> and he that drinketh up iniquity like water, upon his <hi>Ale-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ench,</hi> condemns him that will not ſo much as taſte. <hi>They ſpeak evil becauſe you run not into the ſame exceſſe of riot,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. Theſe are <hi>Inexcuſable who judge others, yet do the ſame themſelves.</hi> Rom. 2. 1. Who is the <hi>Troubler of Iſrael</hi> but <hi>Elias?</hi> and who muſt prove him ſo but <hi>Ahab?</hi> The prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wretch in a Pariſh will Judge his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and all the godly in the country. <hi>They are all naught, Hypocrites all,</hi> as bad in a corner as the worſt. I hate hypocriſy (ſay they) and ſhewes of Religion; I would thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170483:90"/> prophaneneſſe too, and ſhewes of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. The Wolfe of old condemned the Lamb, and the <hi>Camel-ſwallower</hi> condemns the <hi>Gnat-eater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. But <hi>Malice</hi> is a <hi>mad Judge,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all reaſon. He ſaith of <hi>Job,</hi> he is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and will ſtand to it, though God himſelf be his Vindicator and Compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. This ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He is mad and hath a devil,</hi> oh <hi>hear him not;</hi> good people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 20.</note> him not; He is a <hi>glutton, winebibber, and ſeditious perſon</hi> too beſides. And <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt he had a devil too.</p>
               <p>We may add to theſe <hi>Judge Abſalom, (Juſtice would be) would to God I were made</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Judge,</hi> ſaith he, would do every honeſtman right) Judge <hi>Ambition,</hi> or <hi>Calumny,</hi> who when his own heart is full of pride, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, impiety and rebellion, and his wayes known to be abominable, like another <hi>Captain mend-all,</hi> the head of an old rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, takes upon him to cenſure the beſt, and to aſperſe all in place of Government, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Miniſters, all may come to him to learn their duty.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing ſome or other of theſe Judges are in every place, no marvel that all places are full of Judgement, and all Judgements full of perverſneſſe; <hi>Judgement running down like a river,</hi> but righteouſneſſe dried up as the Red Sea.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Contemptuous,</hi> diſparaging, undervaluing <note place="margin">Contemptuous Thoughts.</note> and inſulting thoughts; whereas our duty
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170483:90"/> is <hi>in point of honor, to prefer others,</hi> and take <note place="margin">Ro. 12. 10.</note> ſhame to our ſelves. He that is <hi>void of underſtanding deſpiſeth his neighbour,</hi> Pro. 11. 12. A ſtinking weed this is which groweth onely in a dunghill. Never found but in a baſe, or ungracious heart: The <hi>Sorry bondwoman</hi> when ſhe ſaw ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and her miſtris barren, was a better woman then her miſtriſſe, and ſlights her <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 4. Pſal. 10. 5. and 12. 5.</note> as much as the dirt under her feet. And the wicked man is oft deſcribed by his <hi>puſſing at</hi> every one, he is ſo puft up himſelf with Arrogance, that he puffes at every other man with inſolency and contempt.</p>
               <p>3. Again, <hi>Overweening</hi> and <hi>Magnifying</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Overweening thoughts.</note> thoughts of ſome, to the diſparaging of others are as bad, and making odious <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons</hi> and unbeſeeming differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, according as privat intereſt or affection ſwaies the judgment. This began in the Apoſtles times, and is Epidemicall and rife in our dayes: <hi>To</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>think of men above what is written, and to be puffed up for one, againſt another.</hi> I am for <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 4, 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith one, But <hi>Apollos</hi> for me, ſaith another, and <hi>Cephas</hi> is beyond them both, ſaith a third. But <hi>who is Paul, and who Apollos? Are they not one?</hi> They are good men all and agree, do you alſo agree <note place="margin">Ingeniis non ille favet, plaudit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſepultis. Noſtra ſed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnat, nos, noſtraque livi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus odit. Horat.</note> and rend not the Church by Diviſions. It were a fond thing if one ſhould ſay this <hi>Moon</hi> is a rare moon, The laſt was as good, the next will be as good. To ſay of this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170483:91"/> man dead, <hi>He was a man,</hi> none like him, of that Miniſter to whom thou art a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, him I like; and to ſlight the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters, thy own eſpecially (if faithfull and godly) ſhewes great precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy of judgment, but little Sincerity. The Jewes gloryed, they were <hi>Moſes diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jo. 9. 28.</note> took it in ſcorn to be <hi>Chriſts</hi> diſciples, and to learn of him. But <hi>Moſes</hi> was bad <note place="margin">Ex. 17. 4.</note> enough while he lived, much ado he had to eſcape <hi>Stoning</hi> once. The dead <hi>Prophets</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Extinctus ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur Idem.</note> tombes muſt be <hi>Garniſht,</hi> and names muſt be <hi>Kalendered,</hi> while the living muſt be perſecuted, and their names buried in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. If <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> were alive, they would wonder how they came to be called Saints, when others that preach the ſame doctrins are Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized, or reproched.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Cunning craftineſſe</hi> whereby men lie in <note place="margin">Craftineſſe. Act. 13. 10.</note> wait to deceive, This turnes men into <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> and makes men the children of the <hi>devil,</hi> who is full of ſubtilty and miſchief. Though this be cryed up as the Art of Arts, and the higheſt wiſdome. <hi>Qui neſcit diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulare, neſcit vivere:</hi> Wee ſay, He that cant diſſemble muſt look to live deſpiſed, and dye a begger; <hi>Jonadab</hi> the ſon of <hi>Shimeah</hi> ſuch a ſubtle Sycophant, and ſly <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 3.</note> companion, that he could tell <hi>Amnon</hi> how to defloure <hi>Tamar</hi> and ſhee ſhould neither be aware, nor could avoid it. <hi>Abſalom</hi> was ſo perfect in this Art, that he courted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170483:91"/> and gained all the people to depoſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſet up himſelf, that judgment <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 6.</note> might run down as a River and Juſtice as a ſtream. <hi>Jacob</hi> a plain man himſelf, had ſons too nimble at this, who firſt <hi>over-reached,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 13.</note> then <hi>Maſſacred</hi> the men of <hi>Shechem. Into their ſecret let not my ſoule come,</hi> ſay thou with <hi>Jacob: Curſed be this wrath,</hi> Curſed this <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 6, 7.</note> pollicy, the one is cruell, the other hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. The Godly mans rejoycing, is that <hi>in ſimplicity and Godly ſincerity, not fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he hath his converſation in the world,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12. and 4. 2.</note> And accounts it his glory to ſay, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the <hi>hidden things of diſhoneſty,</hi> not walking in craftineſſe. And while the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed projects how to <hi>lay ſnares privily,</hi> and to <hi>ſwallow up</hi> others <hi>alive as the grave,</hi> and to <note place="margin">Pro. 1. 11. Neh. 4. 11.</note> come over them, ſo as <hi>they ſhall not ſee nor know</hi> who hurts them, The Godly man ſaith, <hi>let integrity and uprightneſſe preſerve me,</hi> or let <note place="margin">Micah. 7. 2.</note> me periſh.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Treacherous and miſchievous</hi> thoughts, <note place="margin">Treacherous thoughts.</note> when greateſt good-will pretended; this is to be ſuperlatively wicked, a <hi>devil incarnate,</hi> as <hi>Judas</hi> was, who betraies his Maſter <hi>with a kiſſe,</hi> words ſmoother then oyle, yet war in his heart. <hi>Abſalom</hi> intertaines <hi>Amnon</hi> with good cheer, and a <hi>ſword</hi> is <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 28.</note> preſented for the <hi>ſecond courſe; Jael-</hi>like <note place="margin">Jud. 4. 19, 20.</note> begin with butter, and milk, and end with hammers, and nailes. Thus, thoſe Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants and arch diſſemblers who came to Chriſt, with <hi>Maſter we know thou art true</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:170483:92"/> and able to reſolve us, we have a caſe of conſcience which troubles us, tell us what <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 16.</note> we ſhall do; all the while inſidiating and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wait for him.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Revengfull and malicious</hi> thoughts are <note place="margin">Revengfull thoughts.</note> worſt of all, ſuch as <hi>Cains</hi> againſt <hi>Abell,</hi> and <hi>Eſaus</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> who reſolved to be revenged though he defer'd it till his father was dead; <hi>Abſaloms</hi> to <hi>Amnon,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his intended murther for <hi>two whole</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>years,</hi> yet at laſt it brake forth againſt all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and <hi>Hamans</hi> to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who <note place="margin">Eſt. 3. 7.</note> for a <hi>twelvemonth</hi> together was caſting lots and meditating revenge to the purpoſe; Such the men of <hi>Anathoth, Jeremies</hi> next <note place="margin">Jer. 11. and 20. 10.</note> neighbours, againſt him, who <hi>watched for his halting ſaying peradventure he will be enticed and we ſhall prevaile againſt him,</hi> and then we ſhall take <hi>our revenge on him.</hi> Such <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> brethrens curteſie to him: This is to <note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> be totally <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> whoſe thoughts are onely <hi>thoughts of peace, not of evil,</hi> though he never want <hi>power</hi> to puniſh, and we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe to give him too much <hi>provocation.</hi> This is to be wholly <hi>conformed</hi> to <hi>Satan,</hi> who though he alway ſtrikes not, yet waits like a roaring lyon when to deſtroy. The wicked plotteth againſt the righteous, and ſeeketh to ſlay him. <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note>
               </p>
               <p>7. If our thoughts are not ſo black and <note place="margin">Uncompaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thoughts.</note> bloudy as theſe forenamed, yet may we be to blame by <hi>unſenſible, unſympathizing,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſionate thoughts; If we do not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170483:92"/> mourn <hi>with thoſe that mourn,</hi> and weep for <note place="margin">Ro. 12. 15. Am 4. 6. Pſal. 109. 16. Col. 3. 12.</note> the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> What direfull <hi>impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> doth <hi>David</hi> pour out againſt his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, becauſe they remembred not to ſhew mercy, <hi>&amp;c. Put on,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>as</hi> the <hi>elect of God, bowells of mercies, kindneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>8. Laſtly to make haſt out of this Sodom, we may take notice of a Company of <hi>Vile wiſhes,</hi> and riſings up of heart againſt our neighbour ready to break forth into open execrations, curſes and imprecations, But there they lie muttering and murmuring, like a company of young adders in their den, which though they yet ſting and poiſon not, they keep a hiſſing and put out their tongues, that you may know whoſe breed they are and what they would do, had they more power. Theſe are all breaches of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law of love which bids us <hi>bleſſe, but curſe not,</hi> forbids <hi>gruding, Le. 19. 18.

               </p>
               <p>3. There is another worſe then this, <hi>a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical and helliſh</hi> mirth, To <hi>rejoyce to do evil</hi> themſelves, and <hi>delight in the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of others,</hi> Prov. 2. 14. to whom it is <hi>meat and drink</hi> to do miſchief, as is ſaid in another place, <hi>they ſleep not except they have done miſchief,—for they eat the bread of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and drink the wine of violence,</hi> Prov. 4. 16, <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 9.</note> 17. <hi>who make a mock of ſinne, and it is a ſport,</hi>

               <p>There are two ſights Satan is much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to behold. To ſee a Godly man ſad, and a wicked man merry, and all his art is uſed to keep them ſo. To the wicked he ſaith in the worlds ſalutation, <hi>ſit you merry.</hi> And to the Godly he ſaith, <hi>why are not thou more ſad?</hi> And as he hath his temptations for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very temper, ſo his watch-word is to the wicked, as <hi>Abſaloms</hi> concerning <hi>Amnon; Mark when his heart is merry, then ſtrike him,</hi> 2 Sam. 13. 28. With the Godly he deales as <hi>Amalek</hi> with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtrikes them <hi>when down and feeble;</hi> or as <hi>Simeon and Levi</hi> to the men <note place="margin">Deut. 25. 18.</note> of <hi>Schechem, came upon them when they were</hi>

               <p>Theſe two are Satans greateſt <hi>Stratagems</hi> and chief <hi>ſupporters</hi> of his kingdome, but he prevails more by <hi>mirth,</hi> then mourning; He ſaith of his jeſts and mirth, as prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Leo the Tenth</hi> ſaid, <hi>quantum nobis profuit iſta fabula?</hi> How much have theſe fables, toyes, and jeſts promoted our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?</p>
               <p>Therefore is a godly man more afraid of mirth than mourning; He ſaith of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what doſt thou mean? and of mirth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170483:102"/> art thou not madneſſe and have I <hi>any need</hi> of madneſſe, or Religion of mad men, as once <hi>Achiſh</hi> ſaid? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 15.</p>

               <p>It is noted of the Wiſe, <hi>His heart is in the houſe of mourning, but the Fooles in the houſe of laughter,</hi> Eccl. 7. 4. and that of the two, <hi>mourning is better than rejoycing,</hi> for if it <hi>mar</hi> the countenance, it mends the heart. <hi>By the ſadneſſe of the countenance the heart is made better,</hi> Eccl. 7. 3.</p>

Their <hi>inward part is very wickedneſſe,</hi> Pſal. 5. The Lords eye is upon the heart and thoughts, Jer. 6. 19. The evil of thoughts how little ſoever they be thought, are the greateſt evils; Satans ſins are onely ſpirituall wickedneſſes, not carnall, or bodily pollutions, <hi>nihil fecit, nihil opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt Satanas, ſolummodo cogitavit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> The devil <hi>wrought</hi> not evil, onely <hi>thought</hi> evil.

Inſtance in the worſt of ſins we ſhall find them here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is <hi>ignorance</hi> a great ſin? The Lord <hi>ſhall come in flaming fire to render vengeance to them who know not God;</hi> This is as bad as

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Yea, as all the <hi>Treaſures</hi> of grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the Godly are laid up in the <hi>hidden man of the heart,</hi> there is his beſt, and he is a <hi>thouſand times</hi> better in his heart, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deſire, then he can be in all his holy acts and duties, he would do much more and better ſtill; ſo the worſt wickedneſſe even in the moſt wicked, is <hi>within,</hi> when he doth moſt villanouſly, and talketh moſt impudently, his <hi>heart</hi> is a thouſand times worſe yet then all his actions, for this as it is the <hi>ſeat</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and vertue, ſo of <hi>all ſin</hi> and vice.</p>

But to ill thoughts we ſet doors wide open, we make room to entertain them, we keep them company, diſcourſe with them with much delight, and never think the time long they ſtay, and are loth to let them go.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX. The Third Uſe of Information in ſeverall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</head>
               <p>THE third uſe informes us of divers weighty points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What a wide and vaſt difference there is between the <hi>lawes of men</hi> and the <hi>pure law</hi> of God: All thoſe fall far ſhort of this; they reach but the outward man, this the heart, ſpirit, conſcience, and the moſt hidden thoughts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. Their Laws are <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> this <hi>Spirituall,</hi> holy, requiring truth in the inward parts. This applies Canons <note place="margin">Rom. 7 14.</note> and Engins to the mind, and forbids <hi>luſt</hi> in the firſt <hi>motions,</hi> checks the thought of <hi>Belial,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 4, 5. Rom. 7 7.</note> or wickedneſſe (as it is cal'd) in the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9. The Laws <hi>of men</hi> require no more but to <hi>ſtrike</hi> the <hi>topſale,</hi> (in a civil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour) The Law <hi>of God</hi> boards every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, cals for the bils of lading, makes a through ſearch in every Cabin, ſees what we are fraught with, and if it find any prohibited wares (not goods) or concealed armes for the uſe of the enemy, they are ſeized on, and the veſſell muſt yield or ſink. The Laws of men plant their Ordinance againſt the <hi>Enemies colours,</hi> ſet out upon the wals of the Caſtle; That of God undermines the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> and blows up all that ſtand in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170483:120"/> The Magiſtrate onely provides, <hi>ne peccatum turbet,</hi> God, <hi>ne ſit;</hi> he <hi>ne peccatum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtat,</hi> God <hi>ne reſtet.</hi> We may be <hi>Boni cives, mali Chriſtiani.</hi> We may obſerve the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the God of the land,</hi> as they ſaid, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 27. Yet not know or keep the Laws of the <hi>God of heaven.</hi> The Statutes of <hi>Omri,</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> are oft-times kept by <note place="margin">Mit. 6. 16.</note> thoſe who violate the Edicts of <hi>Sion,</hi> and of Chriſt. The Chriſtian therefore muſt not be a <hi>Statute Chriſtian,</hi> but a <hi>Scripture Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What a ſad difference there is between the holy <hi>Law of God,</hi> and our <hi>baſe hearts.</hi> His Law pure, we impure, that ſpirituall, we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. It was an uneven and uncomfortable match between beautifull, courteous, and vertuous <hi>Abigail,</hi> and that clown and ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious churle <hi>Nabal,</hi> that between beautifull <hi>Moſes,</hi> and black <hi>Zipporah,</hi> but Gods Law and our hearts are worſe matched. But thoſe were the worſt matches in all the Scriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2, 4. when the Sons of God went in to the daughters of men, they begat that Gygantean and vicious race, which corrupted the whole earth; But this is the worſt match in the world, wherein the Law of God is married to the heart of man. <hi>For the motions of ſins which are by the law, do work in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to bring forth fruit to death,</hi> Rom. 7. 6. and hereby is the whole Church corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tables</hi> of the Law were formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170483:121"/> in <hi>ſtone,</hi> and put into an <hi>Ark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with <hi>pure Gold</hi> within and without, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 11. But the Tables of the Law and Covenant of Grace are now written <hi>in Gold,</hi> and put into a homely ark of <hi>ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. What a difference there is between <hi>a godly</hi> and a <hi>wicked</hi> man, a ſincere perſon and a hypocrite, as much or more as between <hi>Solomons</hi> ſhields of beaten maſſy gold, and <note place="margin">1 King. 10. 17. and 14. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Rehoboams</hi> of braſſe, of like ſize and number. Copper and Gold differ not ſo much in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as in their weight and worth; So tin and ſilver look alike, weigh not alike. The difference between man and man is not ſo much in favour, complexion, ſtature, or ſtate, as in the mind; not ſo much in diſeaſes, poverty, miſery as ſin; not ſo much in edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, wit, reaſon, parts, or gifts, as graces. The godly for his outward aſpect is like to an old Church <hi>(Pauls</hi> for example) built of ordinary ſtone; without plain, but when you come in, you find there a comely inſide, handſome ſeats, and a convenient place to worſhip God in. The wicked for his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide not much unlike, yet more fitly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a priſon <hi>(Newgate</hi> for example) built of fair ſtone, but within nothing to be found, but naſtineſſe, hunger, hardſhip, ill ſmels, and which is worſt of all, a company of <hi>Hell-birds,</hi> for their vile behaviour. In a word, the godly are like <hi>heaven,</hi> fair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but the glory is all inviſible, and not to be imagined how great till you come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170483:121"/> And the wicked are like <hi>hell</hi> it ſelf, to which a broad and eaſie way doth lead, but it is bad to deſcribe, but worſe then you can imagine when you enter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What a buſie work is it to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, he hath more to do then to waſh <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Animum rege hunc fraenus hunc tu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſce Catena.</hi> Horat.</note> 
                  <hi>the outſide</hi> of the cup and platter, to make a covenant mith his <hi>eye, ear, hand, foot,</hi> mouth and to <hi>keep his mouth bridled,</hi> he muſt keep his heart bridled. <hi>Keep thy heart with all keeping,</hi> Prov. 4. 23. The God of truth requireth to be worſhipped <hi>in ſpirit and truth,</hi> Joh. 4. 24. in the inward parts. The cleanly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is like thoſe neat Citizens who if they waſh and ſweep their doors to the ſtreet ſide, do waſh and rub, and keep the inſide clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; if they do but bruſh their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward garments, have their inner garments waſht, and the linnen which is next them; ſo the Chriſtian is to cleanſe his hands, but much more to purge and purify his heart.</p>
               <p>The ſincere Chriſtian who would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God is to adorn the <hi>inner man of the heart,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 4. as old <hi>Sarah</hi> did, and to affect to be of the <hi>Kings daughters</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion (the ſpouſe of Chriſt) <hi>all glorious</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. or to be in the <hi>Bridegrooms</hi> faſhion, whoſe outward garment was of four pieces, as all the other <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 12. yet was his inner garment <hi>ſeamleſſe, woven throughout,</hi> and all one piece; Or like <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, whoſe outſide was ſtone,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170483:122"/> inſide gold, eſpecially the <hi>Sanctum ſanctorum, 1 Kings</hi> 6. 30. whoſe very floor, as well as roof was gold within and without, or like his Chariot, the <hi>pillars</hi> whereof were of <hi>ſilver,</hi> but the <hi>bottom</hi> was of <hi>gold, Cant.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>The ſincere ſoul muſt not onely ſee he be the ſame within that without, like <hi>Noahs,</hi> or <hi>Moſes Arke,</hi> the one pitched <hi>within,</hi> as well as <hi>without,</hi> with pitch, for <hi>water-ſervice,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen 6. 14.</note> the other overlaid <hi>with gold within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> for <hi>Divine-ſervice;</hi> and be like the twelve <note place="margin">Exod. 37. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Gates</hi> of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> each of which where <hi>one ſolid, entire pearl,</hi> Rev. 21. 21. But he ſhould rather ſtrive to be more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then he ſeems without, herein differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from other men, as much as the building and framing of Gods City doth from all other buildings in the world; We lay our <hi>foundations</hi> of <hi>courſe</hi> and rougher <hi>ſtone,</hi> but build up with <hi>fairer;</hi> But the holy Cities <hi>ſtreets was paved with gold,</hi> the <hi>wall</hi> was <hi>Jaſper,</hi> but the foundations exceeded all, <hi>The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the wall were garniſhed with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of precious ſtones.</hi> Rev. 21. 18, 19. What a rare ſpeech was that of an Heathen? We ſhould alwaies ſo act and live, as if we were <note place="margin">Sic certe viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectu viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Sic cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam aliquis in pectus intimum inſpicere poſſit. quid enim prodeſt ab homine aliquid eſse ſecretum, nihil Deo clauſum. Intereſt animis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris &amp; mediis cogitationibus intervenit, Seneca.</note> in open view, and ſo think, as if there were ſome one looking into our heart. For what doth it profit, to be hid from man, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170483:122"/> is to God. He ſteps into our mindes, and walkes in the midſt of our thoughts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It informs us of another moſt ſad and weighty point, how <hi>far a hypocrite may go,</hi> and how high he may fly, yet at laſt fall low, and periſh in ſome unſuſpected ſin. There be many die of <hi>Occult</hi> and unknown diſeaſes, who are opened when they are dead, then it is ſeen what they died of, but then too late, but there be more die of <hi>unknown ſins,</hi> who would not have their hearts opened here as <hi>Lydias</hi> was, that they might have lived; But then it is too late, when they are dead and gone themſelves, to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of it. <hi>Magus,</hi> next to <hi>Judas,</hi> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of an arch hypocrite, as any in all the Bible; he came on apace, of a late <hi>Sorcerer</hi> a new <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> and all the talk and news of <hi>Samaria,</hi> was of <hi>Simons</hi> converſion and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary forwardneſſe and piety. He out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrips them all, <hi>he hears, believes, is baptized, continueth with the godly, contributeth, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

                  <hi>more then all the reſt,</hi> and ſits more cloſe to the Preacher. Who <hi>dips</hi> his hand uſually ſo ſoon in the diſh as the <hi>Traitor?</hi> Here if any were in Scripture, you may lively behold a <hi>falling</hi> ſtar, a <hi>waſhed</hi> ſwine, a <hi>painted</hi> ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, the <hi>unclean ſpirit</hi> going out and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in his hopefull ſtepping forward, and mounting upward, and in his ſhamefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and dolefull declination.</p>
               <p>1. How many ſteps are here of his aſcent,

               <p>AND that thy heart may be rid of theſe evil gueſts of ſinfull thoughts, and kept from them; obſerve theſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſcientiouſly uſe theſe meanes here preſcribed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Above all getting to get thee a right and new heart;</hi> thy heart is <hi>not right,</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Magus</hi> here, therefore thy <hi>thoughts</hi> ſo curſed. Pray with <hi>David, Create in me O <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 10</note> Lord a new heart, and renew a right ſpirit within me;</hi> The heart is the ſpring and treaſure, ſuch as the heart, ſuch the thought muſt needs be. Get the <hi>ſpring healed,</hi> or the waters muſt needs be <hi>unſavoury,</hi> 2 King. 2. 22. Get the heart <hi>well waſhed,</hi> or <hi>unclean thoughts</hi> will not out, Jer. 4. 14. If the <hi>Lungs</hi> be putrid, and rotten, the <hi>breath</hi> will ſmell; powders and perfumes on thy apparell <hi>ſweeten</hi> not thy breath: If the garment be ſpotted, it is not a new lace
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170483:151"/> or trimming, but waſhing or bruſhing that cleanſeth it; if the hand be foul, it is not a faire glove or Gold ring, but waſhing that mends it; So it is nothing will cure the evil thought, without waſhing, purging and mending the heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Above all keeping keep thyheart,</hi> Pro. 4. 23. This is the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>great</hi> commandment, yea the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> too, on which hang all the law and the Prophets (the old and new Teſtament) <hi>keep</hi> thy <hi>heart</hi> and thou doſt <hi>love the Lord with all thy heart;</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> thy <hi>heart,</hi> and thou doſt <hi>love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe;</hi> this is <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque tabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> keep it and thou doſt keep all the ten Commandments.

               <p n="5">5. It is made every mans particular and perſonall duty, keep thy heart thy ſelfe, another may be thy <hi>Parke-keeper;</hi> Thy <hi>caſh-keeper,</hi> thy <hi>

               <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon is, keep thy heart and thou <hi>keepeſt all,</hi> as I ſaid, thy <hi>mouth</hi> thy <hi>eye,</hi> thy <hi>foot,</hi> (thy <hi>path, v. 24, 25, 26, 27.</hi> As <hi>great men,</hi> have a <hi>Porter</hi> ſtand at the great gate, and <hi>all men</hi> have ſtronger <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward doors,</hi> locks, bats and bolts, there to keep the entrance ſafe, then are the inner roomes all ſecured, ſo keep thy heart well and the whole houſe (the whole man) is ſafe. The heart muſt have a watch,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170483:152"/> or ſentinell continually ſet before it, and is never to be truſted without a keeper. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this ſet as the porch, or porter, before all theſe other duties following.</p>
               <p>And here I might ſpeak a little more particularly of this heart keeping work, but I ſhall haſten to an end, I might tell you <hi>what</hi> it is to keep the heart, and <hi>how</hi> it muſt be kept. To keep the heart, implies <hi>two things.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To <hi>obſerve.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. To <hi>preſerve</hi> it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be an <hi>evil</hi> heart, it would be <hi>obſerved,</hi> not kept, it is better to change then keep an evil heart, no <hi>breed</hi> ſo bad to keep as the evil heart, <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> Out of it are the <hi>Iſſues</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 10. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>of death,</hi> yet <hi>obſerved</hi> it would be what the <hi>temper</hi> of it is, what the <hi>haunt,</hi> what the <hi>diſeaſes</hi> of it are, and <hi>kept</hi> the evil heart had need be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Kept <hi>cloſe priſioner,</hi> give it not too much liberty, keep it from evil companions, from ſinfull objects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do with an untoward heart as we do with <hi>a ſtubborn child,</hi> put him to a Maſter that will keep him in awe; we put our horſe to break to a skillfull rider, chuſe to put thy heart into the hands of a Miniſter, skilfull in that excellent art of <hi>heart-breaking</hi> and <hi>heart-taming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Keep an evil heart with hard fare, with the <hi>bread of affliction,</hi> and <hi>water of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170483:153"/> affliction,</hi> let it have nothing ſet before it, but the <hi>terrors of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> the <hi>ſentence of the Law,</hi> the <hi>day of judgement,</hi> the <hi>torments of hell;</hi> A bad heart can't be kept too hard, as a good heart too well.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Truſt not a bad heart at any time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>keeper, a double</hi> keeper; Thy own <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi> is not able to keep it, deſire <hi>God</hi> to aſſiſt thy <hi>reſolution,</hi> that it may neither be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed nor baffled by his priſoner.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But as ſoon as thou canſt rid thy hands of this evil heart, or get it changed; men care not for keeping a <hi>dead commodity</hi> by them, in which there is loſſe; The bad heart is the worſt <hi>dead commodity</hi> we can keep by us, part with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the <hi>good</hi> heart is to be preſerved, and kept in good plight, well lookt to, and duely ordered, nothing <hi>needs</hi> it more, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>deſerves</hi> it more, no garden needs ſo much looking to, that it may be well kept, nothing will ſo recompence thee. We ſay <hi>Keep thy ſhop and it will keep thee;</hi> but keep <hi>thy heart well</hi> and it will ſurely <hi>keep thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Keep it in <hi>tenderneſſe,</hi> be more choice of this then of the apple of thine eye. You may keep your child too tenderly, cannot keep your heart too renderly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>tender hearted</hi> perſon howſoever he lives, whereſoever he dyes, ever <hi>dies in peace,</hi> as was promiſed to <hi>Joſtah, 2 Chron.</hi> 34. 27.</p>

               <p>Three things help to make us more ready and willing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Frequency</hi> and familiarity with <hi>duties.</hi> Uſe makes perfectneſſe. By <hi>praying</hi> thou wilt learn to <hi>pray.</hi> An inſtrument daily uſed is ſoon fit to play upon, long diſuſed asks much time to tune it. How unfit muſt they needs be for prayer, that pray not from ſabbath to ſabbath?</p>
               <p n="2">2. To conſider that God <hi>accepts a willing</hi> mind for the beſt <hi>deed,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All other ſervice is <hi>unacceptable</hi> to God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9, 10. <hi>Unprofitable</hi> for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 17.</p>
               <p n="4">8. <hi>In ſteadineſſe,</hi> Pſal. 108. 1. Act. 11. 23. <hi>Cleave to God with full purpoſe of heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three times when we ſhould look to keep the heart ſteady.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ſtate <hi>of fullneſſe,</hi> The full veſſel evenly carried tries the ſteady hand and head, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12. I can abound and not be proud, be lifted up, yet not be lifted up. A hard leſſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In time <hi>of ſtraits,</hi> Pſal. 112. 8. <hi>His heart is eſtabliſhed, and doth not ſhrink</hi> and warp, as unſeaſoned timber. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, I will not curſe; God is where he was, I am where I was, my faith where it was, and my integrity I will not let go. This another hard leſſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In <hi>earthly buſineſſe,</hi> to have the heart ſteady, eying God; I am in my calling God
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170483:155"/> ſees me. This a <hi>high leſſon.</hi> The wicked his heart is ſteady and fixed on the world; when at prayer, he cant get the world out of his mind: the godly have heavenly minds in earthly buſineſſes.</p>
               <p>3. Wouldſt thou be free from evil thoughts, then get thy <hi>mind filled,</hi> he which hath his cheſts, his ſhop and his houſe filled, but his mind empty, is a poor man. We muſt not do with our hearts as with our houſes, have the lower rooms furniſht, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the upper garrets but traſh; but have our upper roomes eſpecially furniſhed. Satan comes into the houſe that is <hi>empty, ſwept, and garniſhed;</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt chuſeth to keep his feaſt in an <hi>upper room that is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,</hi> Luke 22. 12. Take ſome good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, promiſe, Scripture, read next thy heart, to keep out wind, every morning. An empty addle heart is a fit bayt for Satan.</p>
               <p>4. Get a heart <hi>fixed,</hi> as well as <hi>filled,</hi> that thy ſpirit ſit not looſe about thee. Keep thy loynes girt, this bow continually bent, <hi>arcum intentio frangit animum remiſſio,</hi> It is too much looſeneſs or unbending that breaks the mind, as too much bending breaks the bow. We love not a garment too big, or ſhoes to ſlop about our feet. We get our armes fixt, get thy mind ſo, and be ever and anon ſaying, <hi>ſurſum corda. The way of life is above to the wiſe, that he may depart from hell beneath,</hi> Prov. 15. 24. How ſafe was <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:170483:156"/> when he could ſay, <hi>O God my heart is fixed, my heart is fixed?</hi> Pſal 108. 1. And the <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 12.</note> ſpirit</hi> is that he prayes for, as well as the <hi>right or new ſpirit.</hi> The devil makes as good ſport with an unfixt ſpirit, as children do with light airy toyes, the <hi>ſquibs, bubbles,</hi> and <hi>empty hoops,</hi> which they drive before them, or the <hi>paper Kite,</hi> driven with the wind, which, though never ſo high mounted, they can pull to them when they will, theſe are <hi>taken captive by Satan at his will,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
               <p>5. See the Lords eye ſtill upon thee, and ſet him at thy right hand, 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. Pſal. 139. 2.</hi> The <hi>eye</hi> of the <hi>Maſter,</hi> awes and reacheth the <hi>Scholar,</hi> and the preſence of the Commander keeps the ſouldier from routing and diſorder.</p>
               <p>6. Plant the word of God as battering Engines, againſt any evil thought approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and take this enemy off before he come too near, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 4. Heb. 4. 12.</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch <hi>Scriptures</hi> as do levell directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy thoughts. If thy thoughts be <hi>vain,</hi> diſcharge theſe Scriptures as Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance againſt them, <hi>Jer. 4. 14. Rom. 1. 21. Epheſ. 4. 17.</hi> If <hi>wanton,</hi> Mat. 5. 28. If <hi>paſſionate,</hi> Mat. 5. 22. If <hi>malicious,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 15. If <hi>covetous,</hi> apply <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5.

               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:170483:156"/>
               <p>7. Attend diligently thy honeſt calling: Employment gives not a portion onely, but protection; and is as neceſſary for the ſoul, as for the bodies health and ſubſiſtance; Give not ear to every idle diverting thought, ſtir not, but follow thy buſineſſe. Say with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> I am about a better work, I am <note place="margin">Neh. 6. 3.</note> not at leiſure to parley with every one that envies my peace and would interrupt my proceedings. Nothing keeps the knife or plow ſhare ſo bright, as continuall uſage, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cauſeth ruſt but want of uſe. It is ſo with the mind; The hour of <hi>Idleneſſe</hi> is the hour of <hi>Temptation. Satan</hi> tempts the <hi>Buſie</hi> man, the <hi>Idle</hi> man tempts <hi>Satan.</hi> Get an honeſt calling firſt, then walk painfully in it.</p>
               <p>8. Look well to thy outward ſenſes, thoſe <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> as one cals them; When the <hi>Suburbs</hi> are fired the <hi>City</hi> will ſoon be taken; if the Enemy be poſſeſt of the <hi>Out-works,</hi> he will ere long make a breach into the <hi>Caſtle:</hi> Sometimes the eye hath <hi>affected</hi> the heart, but more often infected it. <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>David</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 51.</note> were betrayed by their <hi>ſight,</hi> and upright <hi>Noah</hi> by his <hi>taſt</hi> and <hi>palate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not enough that we may ſleep ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there be no thief within the houſe of our Domeſticks, but we muſt look to the doores and windowes that they be made faſt.</p>
               <p>9. Make a <hi>Privy ſearch,</hi> ever and anon, and keep a <hi>privy ſeſſions</hi> often in thy own
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170483:157"/> Juriſdiction, and ſet up a <hi>Court Martiall,</hi> that execution may be done upon mutinous, rebellious, and all diſorderly thoughts; and <hi>having in readineſſe,</hi> ever <hi>to revenge all diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> It is a ſhame that we ſhould <hi>caſt up</hi>

               <p>10. Call in God to help thee in thy <hi>ſearch, Two eyes ſee more then one,</hi> as holy <hi>David</hi> often when he was moſt buiſie to look into himſelf, yet being full of holy jealouſie leaſt he ſhould overlook, prayes, <hi>Lord examine me and prove me, try my reines and my heart, for thy loving kindneſſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth,</hi> Pſal. 26. 2, 3. and Pſal. 139. <hi>throughout.</hi> When he had been ſearching and ſcanning himſelf, he calls in God to help him in his heart, <hi>Search me O God, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting, v.</hi> 23, 24. Oh it is a happy boldneſſe that an upright heart <hi>(mens ſibi conſciarecti)</hi> hath before God, <hi>if our heart condemne us not</hi> (upon a through ſearch) <hi>then have we boldneſſe before God,</hi> 1 Jo. 3. 21. and can
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170483:157"/> lay all before him as confidently, as honeſt <hi>Jacob</hi> leads <hi>Laban</hi> into his tents, and <hi>Judah</hi> and his brethren opened their ſacks, and ſay <hi>ſearch all my ſtuffe, and ſee what thou canſt find,</hi> Gen. 31. 32. How happy is he that can ſay with <hi>Peter, Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> Jo. 21. 17.</p>
               <p>10. Holy, humble, and ſervent <hi>prayer</hi> is another excellent meanes to make and keep the heart clean from evil thoughts, and at ſome times the onely way to rid the heart of theſe meſſengers of <hi>Satan</hi> ſent to buffet us. As the <hi>North wind</hi> drives away the raine, and as <hi>Thunder</hi> purgerh the aire, ſo doth fervent and frequent prayer purge the heart, and drive away thoſe ſoaking ſhowers of evil thoughts; and without prayer, it is as impoſſible to keep the heart clean, as it is to keep the houſe clean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waſhing, or ſweeping: Pray with <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 King. 8. 59. conſidering the untowardneſſe of our hearts; <hi>The Lord incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandements, and his ſtatutes, and his judgments:</hi> And when thy heart is in a good and holy frame, pray with <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 18. <hi>O Lord God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iſrael, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts, of the heart of thy people, and prepare, or ſtabliſh their heart unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. Holy and ſerious <hi>purpoſes</hi> of heart are
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170483:158"/> an excellent <hi>underkeeper</hi> of the heart, <hi>under</hi> God and <hi>after</hi> prayer. Thus did <hi>Daniel</hi> keep himſelf from being defiled, <hi>Daniel purpoſed in his heart,</hi> Dan. 1. 8. And thus did <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhort the primitive Chriſtians, <hi>That with purpoſe of heart they would cleave to the Lord,</hi> Act. 11. 23. But they muſt be Serious purpoſes and reſolutions, <hi>de praeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> not <hi>de futuro,</hi> joyned with preſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, not put off by future promiſes, as <hi>Pharoah, Felix,</hi> and that diſciple did, who ſaid Lord I will follow thee, but I muſt <note place="margin">Lu. 9. 59.</note> firſt ſee my father buried.</p>
               <p>12. Get and learn that excellent, and heavenly art to extract ſome profitable, morall, or divine meditation out of every object and occurrent. <hi>Solomon</hi> by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe raiſed himfelf to that high pitch of wiſdome; he could not ſee the <hi>Ant, Spider,</hi> and <hi>Conies,</hi> he could not look upon the <hi>drunkards eyes,</hi> the beggars <hi>rags,</hi> and the ſluggards <hi>hedge,</hi> but he took out divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations thence to adde to his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to inform his reader; ſo above all that greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> teacheth us this heavenly art, who upon mention of <hi>Leaven, muſtard-ſeed, fiſhers nets, ſeed ſowen</hi> and every thing, raiſed up his own and his hearers mindes to heavenly contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>13. Art thou troubled with evil thoughts, be not then <hi>too much alone,</hi> if thy thoughts are ſad, and black helliſh thoughts. It was <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:170483:158"/> not good for <hi>man to be alone</hi> in his integrity, much leſſe now; it is good yea neceſſary to be <hi>ſometimes</hi> alone, ſometimes in a cloſet <note place="margin">Mat. 14. 23. Mar. 1. 35.

               <p>In the multitude of my many other ſins, my <hi>Thoughts,</hi> perplex my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Aſhamed I am O Lord to ſpeak, and bluſh to think what an heart I have, an heart ſo dark, ſo dead, ſo vain and vile, ſo foul and filthy: A noiſome dunghill, a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſepulchre, a loathſom dungeon, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Peſthouſe, a cage of filthy birds, a ſty of ſwine, a den of theeves. Like that <hi>great tree,</hi> this heart of mine is, wherein are branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es enough for all <hi>fouls</hi> of the ayr to build their <hi>neſts,</hi> and under whoſe ſhade is ſhelter for all the <hi>beaſts</hi> of the earth. A very <hi>Tophet</hi> I may call it, becauſe a <hi>burying place</hi> it is of whatever good is; an <hi>Horma</hi> becauſe a place <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 32. Num. 21. 3. Num. 11. 34. Gen. 14. 10. Hoſ. 4. 15.</note> of <hi>execution</hi> to holy motions and deſire; a <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broth-hattaavah,</hi> becauſe the <hi>grave of luſts;</hi> the vale of <hi>Siddim,</hi> becauſe ſo full of <hi>ſlime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,</hi> yea a <hi>Beth-Aven,</hi> becauſe a <hi>houſe full of iniquity</hi> is in it.</p>
               <p>Ah Lord what thoughts are there! what ſinfull thoughts! my good deſires few, faint, fading; <hi>I think and think not;</hi> I <hi>muſe</hi> and <hi>mind</hi> not; I <hi>like,</hi> but <hi>ſeek</hi> not; <hi>allow,</hi> but <hi>purſue</hi> not; I <hi>know</hi> but <hi>love</hi> not; I <hi>ſay</hi> but <hi>do</hi> not; I <hi>wiſh</hi> but <hi>will</hi> not; A will, or almoſt <hi>half a will</hi> I have, <hi>a power,</hi> and care, and compleat will I want.</p>
               <p>But of ſinfull thoughts, how great the number! how foul the nature, how reſtleſſe their motion, rudely ruſhing in unſent for,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170483:162"/> proudly commanding entertainment, though not bid welcome, refuſing to quit their lodgings, if not by ſtrong hand excluded, though deſired to be gone.</p>
               <p>The good thought how rarely is it ſeen in this <hi>Climat,</hi> as rare almoſt as an <hi>Angel</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> whither once there came a couple, and when <hi>preſſed,</hi> and intreated to come in, had almoſt chuſe rather to lie in the <hi>ſtreets</hi> then come under this <hi>roof,</hi> but when once entred, how do the ſons of <hi>Sodom,</hi> young and old beſet the room, from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, preſſing upon me with violence to have them out, no dores, bars, entreaties of mine can keep them out. Lord put out thy hand, draw in this heart, ſecure theſe heavenly gueſts, and ſtrike theſe ſons of <hi>Sodom</hi> with <hi>blindneſſe,</hi> or <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that they may never find a <hi>door</hi> for entrance.</p>
               <p>Oh! What cold entertainment doth a good thought find! it is either ript out of the womb, as <hi>Hazaell</hi> ript the children out of their mothers bellies, before it is ripe for birth, or caſt out as ſoon as <hi>born,</hi> as the <hi>males of Iſrael</hi> to be deſtroyed, or elſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted to death in <hi>infancy,</hi> as the children in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> by that bloudy <hi>Herod,</hi> who ſought to ſlay thy Son, if it had been poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Lord remember, they that ſeek my life, ſeek thine and thy Chriſts. But let what is of Chriſt be preſerved though all the reſt periſh. In <hi>Egypt,</hi> I read the more
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170483:163"/> thy people were diminiſhed, the more they multiplied; oh that it might be ſo here with me, at leaſt let the Lord leave a ſeed, that I be not as <hi>Sodom,</hi> or made like unto <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have too many other ſins to bewaile, of eye, ear, mouth, hand, foot, and the whole diſeaſed man; <hi>Totus pro corpore morbus.</hi> But as unhappy <hi>Saul</hi> had not it ſeemes hurt enough done him by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi> wounds, but he muſt haſten his <note place="margin">1 Sam. 31. 4.</note> own death, by falling on his own ſword, ſo miſerable I, as if I had not enemies enow abroad, muſt contribute ſomewhat to my own ruine from my ſelf.

Of thy Son, Spirit and grace, how irreverent, confuſed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming! Of thy Word and Works, how many queſtioning, diſliking, and gainſaying thoughts have I!</p>
               <p>And my evil thoughts not <hi>tranſient</hi> and <hi>vaniſhing,</hi> as are my good, but <hi>fixed, deliberate</hi> and <hi>abiding;</hi> either ever <hi>remaining,</hi> or ever and anon <hi>returning.</hi> How ignorant, earthly, carnall is my heart, not ſavouring the things of God, but thoſe which are of <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 23.</note> men! how cold, looſe, dead is my ſpirit! all the wiſdome that is here below, is <hi>earthly,
